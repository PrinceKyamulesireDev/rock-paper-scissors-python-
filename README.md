This is a simple command-line Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in Python. It's my very first coding project â€” and the beginning of many more!

*Features*
-User plays against the computer.
-Keeps track of:
-Wins
-Draws
-Losses
-Gives a summary at the end showing who won overall.

*How to Run*
1. Make sure you have Python installed (any version 3.x).
2. Run the script using your terminal or any Python IDE:
python rps_1.py
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to play.

*What's Next (rps_2, rps_3...)*
[ ] Add multiplayer support for two human players.
[ ] Implement a round-based system (e.g. best of 5).
[ ] Add a GUI version using Tkinter or PyGame.
[ ] Keep a history log of previous moves.
[ ] Improve the computer's AI (e.g., basic prediction).

*Why I Made This*
I'm learning Python and building fun projects as I go. This game helped me understand loops, conditionals, and user input. More to come!
